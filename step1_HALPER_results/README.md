These are the results of running HALPER/HalLiftover on the relevant target and query species. 

They are HALPER files that are the mapped orthologs of the query species to the target species 
using its genomic coordinates. Note that the output file is not experimental data, but what is predicted
to result.

Input: Two ATAC-Seq datasets (one as the sFile and one as the tFile)
Output: HALPER file representing the mapped genomic data.
