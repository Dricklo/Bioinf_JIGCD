## Notes from Lecture for README

- Include steps for running our pipeline

- Have an introduction section and a dependencies section

- Include an install section (?)

- If using conda environments, you can upload the `config.yml`, which details all the packages in the environment:
  
  ```bash
  conda env export > environment_drop.yml
